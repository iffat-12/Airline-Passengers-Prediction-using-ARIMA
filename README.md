## **Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA Model**
The project demonstrates time series forecasting using the ARIMA model on the airline passengers dataset.

### **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to forecast future values of airline passengers based on historical data using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. ARIMA is a widely used statistical method for time series forecasting.

**Key Steps in the Project**
### **Importing Necessary Libraries:**
* Pandas for data manipulation
* NumPy for numerical operations
* Matplotlib for plotting
* Statsmodels for time series analysis (ADF test, ACF, PACF, ARIMA)
* Scikit-learn for normalization and error calculation
  
### **Loading and Preparing Data:**
The dataset used is the monthly airline passengers dataset. Data is loaded from a CSV file hosted on GitHub. The data is plotted to visualize the trend and seasonality.

**Stationarity Check:**
Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is performed to check stationarity.
If the data is not stationary, differencing is applied until stationarity is achieved.


**Data Normalization:**
Min-max scaling is applied to normalize the data, which is required by some machine learning algorithms for optimal performance.


**Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Analysis:**

ACF and PACF plots are generated to determine the parameters of the ARIMA model (p, d, q).
ARIMA Model Building:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
An ARIMA model is fitted to the training data with chosen parameters.
The model's goodness of fit is evaluated using various statistical tests.


### **Model Evaluation and Forecasting:**

Forecasts are made for future time periods (next 12 months in this case) using the trained ARIMA model.
Predicted values are compared with actual values from the test set.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated to quantify the model's prediction accuracy.

### **Results Visualization:**

Original time series data and forecasted values are plotted together for visual comparison.
RMSE value is printed to assess the accuracy of the ARIMA model.
